Quick work log:

22.2.2024
? add steering controls
? add shoulder front-back animation transform which depends on the steering
? check whether or not the slerp func is performing correctly

21.2.2024
+ tux rigid body (makes tux behave according to physics)
+ collisions and a basic floor
+ script for following targets smoothly with slerp func
! problem: muscle check pose generates lower on y axis than it should (bad rig consequence)

20.2.2024
+ tux rig
